			<h4>Background on Information Technology:</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="backpara">
			<p>I’ve always been drawn to the fascinating world of networking within Information Technology. There’s something incredibly rewarding about understanding how systems connect people and devices seamlessly. During my time in school, I’ve had the chance to dive into network design, explore different protocols, and learn about keeping networks secure. This hands-on learning has given me the tools to tackle tricky networking problems and come up with reliable solutions. I’m truly passionate about using technology to build networks that are not only efficient but also safe, fostering innovation and connectivity for everyone involved.</p>
